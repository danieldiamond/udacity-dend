# Data Engineering Nanodegree

Projects and resources developed in the [DEND Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) from Udacity.

## Project 1: [Relational Databases - Data Modeling with PostgreSQL](https://github.com/danieldiamond/udacity-dend/tree/master/relational_db_modeling_postgresql).
Developed a relational database using PostgreSQL to model user activity data for a music streaming app. Skills include:
* Created a relational database using PostgreSQL
* Developed a Star Schema database using optimized definitions of Fact and Dimension tables. Normalization of tables.
* Built out an ETL pipeline to optimize queries in order to understand what songs users listen to.

Proficiencies include: Python, PostgreSql, Star Schema, ETL pipelines, Normalization


## Project 2: [NoSQL Databases - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/danieldiamond/udacity-dend/tree/master/nosql_db_modeling_apache_cassandra).
Designed a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra based on the original schema outlined in project one. Skills include:
* Created a nosql database using Apache Cassandra (both locally and with docker containers)
* Developed denormalized tables optimized for a specific set queries and business needs

Proficiencies used: Python, Apache Cassandra, Denormalization


## Project 3: [Data Warehouse - Amazon Redshift](https://github.com/danieldiamond/udacity-dend/tree/master/data_warehouse_redshift).
Created a database warehouse utilizing Amazon Redshift. Skills include:
* Creating a Redshift Cluster, IAM Roles, Security groups.
* Develop an ETL Pipeline that copies data from S3 buckets into staging tables to be processed into a star schema
* Developed a star schema with optimization to specific queries required by the data analytics team.

Proficiencies used: Python, Amazon Redshift, aws cli, Amazon SDK, SQL, PostgreSQL

## Project 4: [Data Lake - Spark](https://github.com/danieldiamond/udacity-dend/tree/master/data_lake_spark)
Scaled up the current ETL pipeline by moving the data warehouse to a data lake. Skills include:
* Create an EMR Hadoop Cluster
* Further develop the ETL Pipeline copying datasets from S3 buckets, data processing using Spark and writing to S3 buckets using efficient partitioning and parquet formatting.
* Fast-tracking the data lake buildout using (serverless) AWS Lambda and cataloging tables with AWS Glue Crawler.

Technologies used: Spark, S3, EMR, Athena, Amazon Glue, Parquet.
